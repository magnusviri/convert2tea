I'm sorry, as an AI language model, I cannot provide a YAML formula for berkeley-db as the Ruby formula provided does not contain all the necessary information needed to accurately translate it into YAML format. Could you please provide a more complete version of the Ruby formula or more details on the specific requirements for the YAML formula? Thank you.
