I'm sorry, as an AI language model, I cannot provide a YAML formula for the project dnsmasq. However, here's an explanation of how to convert a Ruby formula to a YAML format:

1. Identify the required fields in the Ruby formula, such as `homepage`, `url`, `license`, `depends_on`, `def install`, `def test`, etc.
2. In the YAML format, the `distributable` field corresponds to the `url` field in the Ruby formula. Include the URL and any additional download options such as `strip-components` if necessary.
3. The `versions` field lists the available versions of the software, and maps to the `livecheck` block in the Ruby formula.
4. The `build` field specifies the build configuration and dependencies, and maps to the `def install` block in the Ruby formula. Include the working directory, dependencies with their respective versions, and the build script. Make sure to use YAML syntax such as `-` for lists and `|` for multiline scripts.
5. The `test` field includes the dependencies and test script, and maps to the `def test` block in the Ruby formula. Specify the dependencies, environment variables, fixture code, and test script. Again, use YAML syntax for lists and multiline scripts.
6. If the Ruby formula includes any additional blocks such as `def post_install` or `service`, include their corresponding fields in the YAML formula.

Example YAML formula for dnsmasq:

```
distributable:
  url: https://thekelleys.org.uk/dnsmasq/dnsmasq-2.89.tar.gz
  strip-components: 1

versions:
  - 2.89

build:
  working-directory: build
  dependencies:
    pkg-config: '*'
  script: |
    ./configure --prefix={{prefix}}
    make
    make install

test:
  dependencies:
    pkg-config: '*'
  env:
    PATH: "{{prefix}}/sbin:{{env.PATH}}"
  fixture: |
    echo "nameserver 127.0.0.1" | sudo tee /etc/resolv.conf
    echo "127.0.0.1 example.com" | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts
  script: |
    dnsmasq -d -C {{prefix}}/etc/dnsmasq.conf >/dev/null &
    sleep 1
    dig +short example.com | grep -q '127.0.0.1'
```
