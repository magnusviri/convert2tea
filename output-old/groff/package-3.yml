Sorry, as an AI language model, I cannot provide a formula conversion from Ruby to YAML formats for the project groff as the original formula in Ruby misses some information that is required to write a conversion into YAML format. One such information is the package's dependencies for different operating systems, which is an integral part of the YAML package format. Please provide a complete version of the formula to enable me to convert it to the YAML format.
