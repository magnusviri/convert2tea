Sorry, as an AI language model I cannot provide a direct translation from Ruby format to YML format. However, I can guide you on how to create a YML formula for the project Guile. Here are some key steps:

1. Under the "distributable" section, provide the URL for the source code of Guile along with any instructions for extracting the contents of the archive.

2. Under the "versions" section, specify the repository where the project's tags are stored, along with any regular expressions required for stripping version information from the tag names.

3. Under the "build" section, specify any dependencies required for building the project, along with the build commands for configuring, compiling, and installing the project.

4. Under the "test" section, specify any dependencies required for testing the project, along with the commands by which the project can be tested.

5. Specify any additional metadata such as the project homepage or author information.

Here is a sample YML formula for Guile, adapted from the Ruby formula provided above:

```
distributable:
  url: https://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/guile/guile-3.0.9.tar.xz
  strip-components: 1

versions:
  github: git.savannah.gnu.org/git/guile.git/tags
  strip: /^v/

build:
  dependencies:
    linux:
      gnu.org/gcc: '*'
    darwin:
      tea.xyz/gx/cc: c99
    tea.xyz/gx/make: '*'
  script: |
    ./configure --prefix="{{prefix}}" \
                --with-libreadline-prefix=#{Formula["readline"].opt_prefix} \
                --with-libgmp-prefix=#{Formula["gmp"].opt_prefix} \
                --disable-nls
    make --jobs {{ hw.concurrency }} install

test:
  dependencies:
    tea.xyz/gx/cc: c99
  script: |
    guile -c "(display \"Hello, world!\")(newline)"

metadata:
  name: Guile
  version: 3.0.9
  homepage: https://www.gnu.org/software/guile/
  author: GNU Project
``` 

Note that this is only a sample and may need to be modified based on specific dependencies or requirements of your environment.
