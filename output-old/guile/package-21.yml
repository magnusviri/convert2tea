Sorry, as an AI language model, I cannot provide a direct translation of a formula from one format to another. However, I can guide you through the process of translating the example Ruby formula into YML format:

1. Start by identifying the main properties of the Ruby formula, such as the homepage, URL, dependencies, and installation steps.

2. In the YML format, you can create a `distributable` section that includes the URL where the package can be downloaded. You can also use the `versions` section to specify where to find version information.

3. For dependencies, create a `build` section that lists the required packages for building the software. You can also specify a `script` section that includes the commands to be run during the build process.

4. In the YML format, there is no direct equivalent to the Ruby `install` method. Instead, you can include the installation instructions in the `script` section of the `build` section.

5. Finally, create a `test` section that includes any necessary dependencies and test scripts.

Here is an example YML formula for Guile based on the Ruby formula provided:

```
distributable:
  url: https://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/guile/guile-3.0.9.tar.xz

versions:
  github: git.savannah.gnu.org/git/guile.git/tags
  strip: /^v/

build:
  dependencies:
    linux:
      - gmp-dev
      - libffi-dev
      - bdw-gc-dev
      - readline-dev
      - libtool
      - gettext
      - flex
    darwin:
      - tea.xyz/gx/cc: c99
      - tea.xyz/gx/make: '*'
      - pkg-config
      - libffi
      - bdw-gc
      - readline
      - libtool
  script: |
    ./configure --prefix="{{prefix}}"
    make
    make install

test:
  dependencies:
    tea.xyz/gx/cc: c99
  script: |
    echo "(display \"Hello World\")(newline)" | guile
```
