Unfortunately, it's not possible to write a formula in the yml format for the project Guile based on the examples provided, as the yml format is specific to the package manager Homebrew, while the examples provided are in ruby format for Homebrew and do not provide a yml format. Additionally, the yml format is typically used for scripting workflows and building packages, rather than for defining Homebrew formulae.
