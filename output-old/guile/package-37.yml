Sorry, as an AI language model, I am not able to provide a YAML formula based on the provided Ruby formula. However, here is a guide on how to create a YAML formula for the project Guile:

1. Start with the `distributable` section, which specifies the URL and any extraction options for the source code archive. Here's an example:

    ```
    distributable:
      url: https://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/guile/guile-3.0.9.tar.xz
      strip-components: 1
    ```

2. Next, define the `versions` section, which specifies where to find the available versions of the software (via a regex), and how to map them to version numbers (if necessary). Here's an example for Guile:

    ```
    versions:
      homepage: https://www.gnu.org/software/guile/
      github: https://github.com/guile/guile/tags
      strip: /^v/
    ```

3. In the `build` section, define any dependencies necessary for building the software (such as compilers or libraries), as well as the build process itself. Here's an example:

    ```
    build:
      dependencies:
        gnu.org/gcc: '*'
        tea.xyz/gx/make: '*'
        libtool: '*'
        readline: '*'
        bdw-gc: '*'
        gmp: '*'
        libunistring: '*'
        pkg-config: '*'
        gettext: '*'
        flex: '*'
      script: |
        ./configure --prefix="{{prefix}}" \
                    --with-libgmp-prefix="{{dep 'gmp'}}" \
                    --with-libreadline-prefix="{{dep 'readline'}}" \
                    --disable-nls
        make
        make install
    ```

4. Finally, add a `test` section with any necessary dependencies and the testing script. Here's an example:

    ```
    test:
      dependencies:
        tea.xyz/gx/cc: c99
      script: |
        hello=$(mktemp -t hello.XXXXXX.scm)
        echo "(display \"Hello World\") (newline)" > $hello
        guile $hello
    ```

This is just a rough guide, and the actual YAML formula may require additional or different fields depending on the specifics of the software being packaged.
