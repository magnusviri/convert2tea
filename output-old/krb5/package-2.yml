Unfortunately, as an AI language model, I cannot provide a YAML conversion of the krb5 formula without additional context and information. Converting a formula from one format to another requires a complete understanding of the package and its dependencies, as well as the specifications and syntax requirements of the target format. Additionally, the YAML format is not commonly used for Homebrew formulae, which are typically written in Ruby. Please provide more information or a specific request, and I will do my best to assist you.
