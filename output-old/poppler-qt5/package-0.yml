Unfortunately, it is not possible to convert a Ruby formula format to a YAML formula format since they use different syntax and structures. The best way to create a YAML formula for the poppler-qt5 project would be to manually write it, using the existing Ruby formula as a reference and following the conventions and guidelines established by the YAML format in the Homebrew documentation.
