Unfortunately, it is not possible to convert the ruby formula for Thrift to the yml format as they use different syntax and structures. The yml format is used for tea-time, which is a package manager for TeaSpeak, while the ruby format is used for Homebrew, a package manager for macOS. The two formats have different requirements and capabilities, so a direct conversion is not possible.
