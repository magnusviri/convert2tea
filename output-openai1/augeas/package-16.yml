Sorry, As an AI language model, I am not able to create YAML formula based on a Ruby formula without proper context and requirements, because both formats have their own syntax and structure for defining dependencies, build instructions, and other package details. Could you please provide me the necessary information and requirements to create the required YAML formula?
