Unfortunately, it is not possible to directly convert a ruby formula to a yml format formula as they have different syntax and structure. The yml format typically involves defining attributes for the distributable, versions, dependencies, build process, and testing process. Meanwhile, a ruby formula is defined using a DSL specific to Homebrew. To create a yml formula for Augeas, one would need to manually define the necessary attributes and commands in the appropriate yml format.
