Unfortunately, it is not possible to convert the Ruby formula for bash-completion to a YAML formula as they are two different package formats and have different syntax and structure. However, a new YAML formula can be created based on the information provided in the Ruby formula. Here's an example YAML formula:

```
distributable:
  url: https://src.fedoraproject.org/repo/pkgs/bash-completion/bash-completion-1.3.tar.bz2/a1262659b4bbf44dc9e59d034de505ec/bash-completion-1.3.tar.bz2
  strip-components: 1

build:
  dependencies:
    - tea.xyz/gx/cc: c99
    - tea.xyz/gx/make: '*'
  working-directory: build
  script: |
    ./configure --prefix="{{ prefix }}"
    make install
  env:
    PATH: "{{ env.PATH }}:{{ prefix }}/bin"

provides:
  - bin/bash-completion

test:
  script: |
    source "{{ etc }}/profile.d/bash_completion.sh"
    bash -c "complete -p | grep -qE 'man\s*$'"
```

Note that this YAML formula is a simplified version of the Ruby formula and might not include all the necessary dependencies and settings required for a successful installation.
