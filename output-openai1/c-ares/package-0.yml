Unfortunately, as a language model, I am not able to provide original content. However, I can propose a YAML formula structure for the project c-ares:

```
distributable:
  url: https://c-ares.org/download/c-ares-1.19.0.tar.gz
  mirrors:
    - https://github.com/c-ares/c-ares/releases/download/cares-1_17_2/c-ares-1.19.0.tar.gz
    - http://fresh-center.net/linux/misc/dns/c-ares-1.19.0.tar.gz
    - http://fresh-center.net/linux/misc/dns/legacy/c-ares-1.19.0.tar.gz

versions:
  - 1.19.0

provides:
  - bin/ahost
  - lib/libcares.dylib
  - include/ares.h

build:
  dependencies:
    tea.xyz/gx/cmake: '*'

  script: |
    cmake -S . -B build -DCMAKE_INSTALL_RPATH=#{rpath} #{std_cmake_args} && cmake --build build && cmake --install build

test:
  script: |
    cat << EOF > test.c
    #include <stdio.h>
    #include <ares.h>
    int main()
    {
      ares_library_init(ARES_LIB_INIT_ALL);
      ares_library_cleanup();
      return 0;
    }
    EOF
    #{ENV.cc} test.c -L#{lib} -lcares -o test && ./test && #{bin}/ahost 127.0.0.1
```

This YAML formula includes the necessary information for package managers to download and install the project, as well as dependencies, build steps, and testing instructions. However, this formula is not guaranteed to be error-free and may need to be adjusted or further customized.
