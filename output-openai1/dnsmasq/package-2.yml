Sorry, as an AI language model, I cannot provide a direct conversion of a Ruby formula to a YAML formula as they have different structures and syntax. However, I can provide guidelines on how to write a YAML formula based on the information provided in the Ruby formula:

1. Start with the name of the package: Dnsmasq
2. Specify the URL where the package can be downloaded:
   ```
   distributable:
     url: https://thekelleys.org.uk/dnsmasq/dnsmasq-{{version}}.tar.gz
     strip-components: 1
   ```
3. Specify the available versions of the package:
   ```
   versions:
     - 2.89
   ```
4. Provide details of the package license/s:
   ```
   license: GPL-2.0-only OR GPL-3.0-only
   ```
5. Specify the dependencies of the package:
   ```
   dependencies:
     - pkg-config
   ```
6. Define the build process required by the package:
   ```
   build:
     working-directory: build
     dependencies:
       tea.xyz/gx/cc: c99
       tea.xyz/gx/make: '*'
     script: |
       ./configure --prefix={{prefix}} \
                   --localstatedir={{var}}/lib/misc/dnsmasq \
                   --runstatedir={{var}}/run/dnsmasq \
                   --conf-file={{etc}}/dnsmasq.conf \
                   --dhcp-script={{etc}}/dnsmasq.d \
                   --no-hosts \
                   --no-resolv \
                   --no-poll \
                   --no-dbus \
                   --no-i18n \
                   --no-daemon
       make
       make install
     ```
7. Define the post-installation process required by the package:
   ```
   post_install:
     - mkdir -p {{var}}/lib/misc/dnsmasq {{var}}/run/dnsmasq
     - mkdir -p {{etc}}/dnsmasq.d/ppp {{etc}}/dnsmasq.d/dhcpc
     - touch {{etc}}/dnsmasq.d/ppp/.keepme {{etc}}/dnsmasq.d/dhcpc/.keepme
   ```
8. Define the service that the package provides:
   ```
   service:
     name: dnsmasq
     run: {{prefix}}/sbin/dnsmasq --keep-in-foreground -C {{etc}}/dnsmasq.conf -7 {{etc}}/dnsmasq.d,*.conf
     keep_alive: true
     require_root: true
   ```
9. Define the package tests:
   ```
   test:
     script: "{{prefix}}/sbin/dnsmasq --test"
   ```
Note: The example YAML formula provided may need further customization and adjustments based on the specific requirements and features of the package.
