Unfortunately, it is not possible to write a formula for the project hicolor-icon-theme in the yml format as it is not a package with a clear dependency tree and cannot be installed using a package manager. The provided example formula in the ruby format uses a configure script and makefile to build and install the icon theme, which cannot be easily expressed in the yml format used for package management tools like Homebrew or Aptitude.
