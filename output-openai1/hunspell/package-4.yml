Unfortunately, it is not possible to provide a YML format for the Hunspell formula without additional information on the dependencies and build process specific to the package manager or environment that will be using the YML file. The example Ruby formula provided contains specific instructions for the Homebrew package manager on macOS, which may not be directly applicable to other package managers or operating systems.
