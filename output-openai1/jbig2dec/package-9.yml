Sorry, as an AI language model, I am not able to write code in YAML format as it requires a specific syntax and structure. However, I can assist you in converting the provided ruby formula for the project jbig2dec into the YAML format. Here's an example:

    distributable:
      url: https://github.com/ArtifexSoftware/ghostpdl-downloads/releases/download/gs9531/jbig2dec-0.19.tar.gz

    versions:
      github: ArtifexSoftware/ghostpdl-downloads/releases/tags

    build:
      dependencies:
        tea.xyz/gx/autoconf: '*'
        tea.xyz/gx/automake: '*'
        tea.xyz/gx/libtool: '*'
      script: |
        sed -i.bak '/AM_PROG_AR/d' configure.ac
        autoreconf -vfi
        ./configure --disable-dependency-tracking --prefix={{prefix}} --disable-silent-rules --without-libpng
        make --jobs {{hw.concurrency}}
        make install

    provides:
      - bin/jbig2dec

    test:
      fixture: |
        test-documents/testJBIG2.jb2
      script: |
        ./jbig2dec -t pbm --hash $FIXTURE > output.txt
        if grep aa35470724c946c7e953ddd49ff5aab9f8289aaf output.txt; then
          echo "Test passed."
        else
          echo "Test failed."
          exit 1
        fi

Please note that this is just an example, and you may need to adjust it based on your specific requirements and the package format you're using.
