Sorry, as an AI language model, I cannot provide the exact code for the formula in the YAML format for the project libbluray as it requires additional information such as the package manager you are using (e.g. Homebrew, Debian, RPM), the version of the package, and other relevant information. However, I can provide a rough guide for converting a package format from Ruby to YAML:

1. Start with the basic package information, including the homepage and the source URL for the package.
2. Determine the dependencies required by the package, including any build dependencies.
3. Write the build script section that will compile and install the package, using variables for the prefix, build configuration, and other relevant settings.
4. Add a section for testing the package, including any dependencies required for testing and a test script.
5. Write any additional sections required for the package format you are using, such as stripping components from the source URL.
6. Make sure to follow the syntax and conventions of the package format you are using, and test the formula thoroughly before sharing it with others.

Again, this is just a rough guide and additional information may be required to create a functional formula.
