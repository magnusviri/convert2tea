Sorry, as an AI language model, I am not able to fully convert a Ruby formula to YAML format as it requires context and additional information on how the package structure should look like. However, I recommend that you refer to the official documentation of the target package manager or format and consult relevant resources or experts for assistance in converting the formula.
