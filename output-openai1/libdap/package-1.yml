Unfortunately, it is not possible to provide a direct conversion from the ruby formula format to the yml format without additional information. The yml format may require additional fields such as version numbers or dependencies that are not explicitly stated in the ruby formula. Additionally, the yml format may require different formatting or syntax than the ruby formula.

To create a yml formula for the project libdap, please provide all the necessary information such as the version, dependencies, and build instructions.
