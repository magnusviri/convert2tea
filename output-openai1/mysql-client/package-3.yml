Sorry, as an AI language model, I cannot provide a translation of `MysqlClient` in the yml format as the yml format is mainly used for configuring data and does not support executable code like in the ruby format. The yml format is not typically used for creating package formulas or recipes. It is usually used for configuration files, data serialization, and other similar purposes.
