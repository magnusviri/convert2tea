The yml format does not have a direct equivalent to the Ruby formula provided, as it is specific to Homebrew and the Ruby language. However, here is an example of how the rbenv formula could be translated into a general yml format for a package manager:

    distributable:
      url: https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv/archive/v{{ version }}.tar.gz
      strip-components: 1

    versions:
      - 1.2.0

    build:
      dependencies:
        tea.xyz/gx/gcc: '*'
        tea.xyz/gx/make: '*'
        tea.xyz/ruby-build: '*'
      script: |
        inreplace "libexec/rbenv" do |s|
          s.gsub! '"${BASH_SOURCE%/*}"/../libexec', libexec
          s.gsub! ":/usr/local/etc/rbenv.d", ":#{prefix}/etc/rbenv.d\\0"
        end

        system "src/configure"
        system "make", "-C", "src"

        prefix.install ["bin", "completions", "libexec", "rbenv.d"]
        man1.install "share/man/man1/rbenv.1"

    test:
      dependencies:
        tea.xyz/gx/gcc: '*'
      script: |
        # Create a fake ruby version and executable.
        rbenv_root={{ prefix }}/rbenv
        ruby_bin=$rbenv_root/versions/1.2.3/bin
        foo_script=$ruby_bin/foo
        echo "echo hello" > $foo_script
        chmod +x $foo_script

        # Test versions.
        source $rbenv_root/bin/rbenv
        versions=$(rbenv versions)
        if [[ "$versions" != *"* system"$'\n'"  1.2.3"* ]]; then
          echo "rbenv versions failed: $versions"
          exit 1
        fi

        # Test rehash.
        rbenv rehash
        if [[ $(<$rbenv_root/shims/foo) == *"Cellar"* ]]; then
          echo "rbenv rehash failed"
          exit 1
        fi

        # Test executable
        rbenv shell 1.2.3
        if [[ $(foo) != *"hello"* ]]; then
          echo "rbenv shell failed: $(foo)"
          exit 1
        fi

This version of the formula follows the same general structure as in the Ruby example, with three main sections: distributable, build, and test. The distributable section specifies how to download and extract the source code archive, and the versions section lists the available versions of the package. The build section specifies the build process, including dependencies and build scripts, and the test section contains the package's test suite. Note that the yml format requires shell scripts to be written using shell syntax, rather than Ruby.
