Sorry, as an AI language model, I cannot provide the exact conversion of the formula for the project ronn in the yml format as it requires additional information such as the dependencies' URLs and their respective versions. However, I can provide a general guideline on how to convert the ruby formula to yml format:

1. Create a distributable section that contains the URL of the source code archive and the number of components to strip when extracting it.
2. Define a versions section that specifies the URL of the page where the project releases are listed and the pattern to extract the version number from the release tag.
3. Define a provides section that lists the executable files that the formula installs.
4. Define a dependencies section that lists the dependencies of the project, including their name, URL, and version range.
5. Define a build section that includes a dependencies sub-section indicating the build-time dependencies required, and a script sub-section that contains the commands to execute during the build process. Also, add an environment variable list that sets the necessary environment variables.
6. Define a test section that lists the dependencies required for running the tests and provides a test script to execute.

Note: Some details may depend on the specific requirements of the project and may need additional tweaking.
