Unfortunately, it is not possible to convert the given formula for the project Telnet into a yml format as it contains dependencies such as `xcode` and `MacOS` which are not supported in yml formulas. Yml formulas are used by package managers like `Chocolatey` and `Scoop` to compile and install packages on Windows platforms only. They do not support compiling packages for Mac or Linux platforms. Therefore, a Ruby formula should be used instead to compile and install Telnet on a Mac.
