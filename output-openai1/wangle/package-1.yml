Unfortunately, it is not possible to write a formula for the project wangle in the yml format as the yml format is not used for Homebrew package management. The yml format is commonly used by other package managers such as Conda, and is not compatible with Homebrew. The only format that can be used for creating Homebrew packages is the Ruby formula format.
