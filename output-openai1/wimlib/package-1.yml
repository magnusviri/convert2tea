Sorry, as an AI language model, I am not able to write YAML code as it requires a specific structure and syntax. However, I can assist you in converting the existing Ruby formula for wimlib into a YAML format.

Here's a possible equivalent YAML formula for the project wimlib:

```
distributable:
  url: https://wimlib.net/downloads/wimlib-{{version}}.tar.gz
  strip-components: 1

versions:
  github: wimlib/wimlib
  strip: /^v/

dependencies:
  openssl.org: ^3.0
  libxml2: '*'

build:
  dependencies:
    tea.xyz/gx/cc: c99
    tea.xyz/gx/make: '*'
  script: |
    ./configure $ARGS
    make --jobs {{ hw.concurrency }} install
  env:
    ARGS:
    - --prefix={{prefix}}
    - --without-fuse
    - --without-ntfs-3g
  test:
    script: |
      dd if=/dev/random of=foo/bar bs={{ 1 if hw.os == 'macos' else '1M' }} count=1
      {{bin_dir}}/wimcapture foo bar.wim
      test -e bar.wim
```

Keep in mind that this is just one possible way to structure the YAML formula, and there can be many variations based on personal preference and requirements. It's important to test the formula thoroughly in your specific environment to ensure it works as expected.
