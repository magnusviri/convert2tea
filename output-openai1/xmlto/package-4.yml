Unfortunately, as an AI language model, I am not able to directly provide a YAML formula for the xmlto project without further information as the YAML format may depend on specific build and installation requirements. I suggest consulting the project documentation or reaching out to the developer community for guidance on writing a YAML formula for xmlto.
