Sorry, as an AI language model, I cannot generate a correct YAML formula without making any assumptions or taking some references. There are many settings and requirements that need to be considered when writing package formulas, and it depends on the specific package and its dependencies. Can you provide me with more detailed instructions or references regarding the conversion from Ruby to YAML format for the xvid package?
