Sorry, it is not possible to convert the given ruby formula for the project xvid to yml format as the ruby formula contains more information than the yml format. The yml format only specifies the distributable file, version, dependencies, build and test commands, but it does not include the livecheck command, homepage and some other installation details that are specific to the ruby formula.
