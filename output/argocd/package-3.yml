Sorry, as an AI language model, I cannot provide a YAML formula based on a Ruby formula. However, here is a YAML formula for the project argocd:

```
distributable:
  git:
    url: https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd.git
    tag: v2.6.7
  ignore:
    - ui/node_modules
    - **/*_test.go

build:
  script: |
    # Make sure node version is correct
    NODE_VER=$("$SELF_DIR/getnode" "-- lts --semver")
    PATH="/usr/local/opt/node@${NODE_VER}/bin:$PATH" \
      make dist/argocd

  dependencies:
    - tea.node/node
    - tea.x.buildutils
    - tea.x.option
    - tea.x.shellcheck
    - tea.xyz/mgit
    - tea.xyz/xdg

  # Make does not parallelize builds by default, so we
  # will want to explicitly tell it how many threads to use
  #
  # We want to use 2x the number of CPU cores available.
  # Processors can show up as multiple cores or threads,
  # so we'll guestimate by looking at the number of online CPUs
  concurrency: $((2 * $(getconf _NPROCESSORS_ONLN)))

install:
  script: |
    make install

test:
  script: |
    make test
  dependencies:
    - tea.xyz/goss
