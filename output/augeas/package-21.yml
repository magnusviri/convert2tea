Sorry, as an AI language model, I can't give an exact written yml formula for the project augeas just by looking at the provided ruby formula. However, I can guide you on how to write a yml formula based on the structure of the ruby formula provided. 

Here are the steps:

1. Identify the name of the project and the package format it is currently in, which in this case is a ruby package formula for the project augeas.
2. Determine the package format you want to convert it to.
3. Identify the key components used in the ruby package formula such as the homepage, url, livecheck, dependencies, build, install, test, etc.
4. Use the key components identified to structure the yml formula by defining the url, version, dependencies, build, test, and other relevant sections based on the chosen package format.
5. Ensure the yml formula is syntactically correct.

Here's a basic example of a yml formula for the project augeas:

    distributable:
      url: https://github.com/hercules-team/augeas/releases/download/release-{{version.marketing}}/augeas-{{version.marketing}}.tar.gz
      strip-components: 1

    versions:
      - 1.14.0

    dependencies:
      libxml2.net: '*'
      readline.net: '*'

    build:
      dependencies:
        autoconf.net: '*'
        automake.net: '*'
        bison.net: '*'
        libtool.net: '*'
        pkg-config.net: '*'
      script: |
        autoreconf --force --install
        ./configure --prefix={{prefix}}
        make
        make install

    provides:
      - bin/augtool

    test:
      script: |
        echo "Hello World!" > test.txt
        augtool -r test.txt
        assert_equal File.read("test.txt"), File.read("test.out.txt")
