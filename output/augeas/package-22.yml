Sorry, as an AI language model, I am not able to provide a conversion from ruby format to yml format for the project "augeas" without missing information. The yml format provided is only a partial representation of a package and some critical details such as package name, version, and dependencies are missing. Can you please provide the missing information or a complete ruby formula for the project augeas so that I can convert it to yml format?
