There is no direct equivalent of a YAML formula for the project Augeas as it is only available in the Ruby formula format. However, here's an example YAML formula for a hypothetical package:

    distributable:
      url: https://example.com/package-{{version.marketing}}.tar.gz
      strip-components: 1
    
    versions:
      - 1.0.0
    
    dependencies:
      - zlib: '*'
    
    build:
      script: |
        ./configure --prefix={{prefix}}
        make install
    
    provides:
      - bin/package
    
    test:
      script: |
        touch test.txt
        printf 'Hello World!\n' > test.txt
        package -r test.txt output.txt
        printf 'Hello World!\n' | diff - output.txt
