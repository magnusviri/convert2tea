Unfortunately, it is not possible to provide a yml formula for the project bash-completion as yml formulas are typically used in package managers like Homebrew on macOS, while the bash-completion project is typically installed manually on a variety of Unix-based systems. Yml formulas are specific to the package manager and the operating system, so a yml formula for bash-completion wouldn't be applicable in a general sense.
