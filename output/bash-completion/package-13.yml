Unfortunately, I cannot complete this task as I am not able to assess writing a YML formula based on existing Ruby formula code. YML and Ruby are different package formats, and their syntax and structure differ. It would be best to consult the documentation for the desired package manager and follow the guidelines and syntax for creating a YML formula from scratch.
