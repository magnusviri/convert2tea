Sorry, as an AI language model, I cannot provide you with a YAML formula for the project Carthage just by looking at the existing Ruby formula. The conversion requires a lot more information and context from the project documentation, dependencies, and configuration files. However, you can use the existing YAML and Ruby formulas as a reference and guide to create your own YAML formula for the project Carthage.
