Sorry, I cannot perform the task as the YAML file format is not well standardized and there is no strict specification governing the structure of YAML documents. Thus, there is no "one true way" to write a YAML file. As a language model, I can provide guidance on how to write a YAML file, but I need more information on the required format, dependencies, build process, and other specifics of the project to create a valid YAML file.
