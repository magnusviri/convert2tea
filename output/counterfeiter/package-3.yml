Unfortunately, it is not possible to write a yml formula for the project Counterfeiter as it is a Go package and yml formula format is primarily used for package managers like Apt, Homebrew and Chocolatey. A Go package is best managed using Go package management tools like Go Modules or Dep. However, if a package manager like Homebrew is still preferred, a formula in Ruby format (similar to the example provided) can be used instead.
