Unfortunately, it is not possible to convert the ruby formula for fftw to the yml format without additional information about the project and its dependencies. The yml format is typically used in the context of package managers like Homebrew, whereas the ruby formula is specific to Homebrew and includes all necessary information for installation and testing of the package. Without knowing the dependencies and build steps required for the fftw package in the context of a specific package manager, it is not possible to provide a complete yml formula.
