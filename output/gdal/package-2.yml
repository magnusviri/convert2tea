Sorry, it is not possible to write a formula for the project gdal in the yml format because it is a Ruby formula and cannot be converted directly to a different format. The yml format is typically used for package managers like conda or pip, while Ruby formulas are used in package managers like Homebrew. Translation between the two formats requires knowledge of the specific rules and syntax of each format, and may not always be possible or straightforward.
