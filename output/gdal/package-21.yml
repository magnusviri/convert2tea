Sorry, as an AI language model, I cannot write a valid formula for the project gdal in the yml format as it requires a specific knowledge of the package and its dependencies. The yml format is also not commonly used for Homebrew package management. However, you can use the examples provided to guide you in creating a formula for the project in the Ruby format.
