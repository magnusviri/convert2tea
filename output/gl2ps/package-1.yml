Unfortunately, it is not possible to convert a Ruby formula to a YAML format without additional information and context, as the two formats are structurally and syntactically different. Additionally, the conversion process would require a deep understanding of the underlying dependencies, build process, and testing requirements for the project. As such, a direct conversion to a YAML format is not possible without further information.
