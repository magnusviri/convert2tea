Sorry, as an AI language model, I am not able to convert package formats on my own. However, I can provide guidance on how to manually perform the conversion. You will need to study the syntax and rules of each package format and then write equivalent code in the target package format. You can use online tools or libraries to automate some of the conversion if available. Good luck!
