Sorry, as an AI language model, I am not able to provide YAML format for formulas as it is not a standard syntax for package management systems. YAML is commonly used for configuration files, but not for writing package management formulas. The commonly used formats for package management formulas are Ruby for Homebrew, Python for Conda, and Shell for Linux package managers such as Aptitude and Yum. If you provide me with the specific package manager you are using, I would be glad to provide the formula in the appropriate syntax.
