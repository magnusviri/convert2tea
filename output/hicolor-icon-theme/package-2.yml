Sorry, but as an AI language model, I cannot provide a direct conversion from Ruby to YAML format for the given project. However, I can guide you on how to create a YAML formula for the project.

Here's a sample YAML formula based on the Ruby example provided:

```
distributable:
  url: https://icon-theme.freedesktop.org/releases/hicolor-icon-theme-{{version}}.tar.xz
  archive_files:
    - hicolor-icon-theme-{{version}}

versions:
  gitlab: xdg/default-icon-theme
  gitlab_branch: master
  strip: /^hicolor-icon-theme[._-]/

dependencies:
  build:
    - gnu.org/autoconf: ^2
    - gnu.org/automake: ^1
  run:
    - gnu.org/tar: '*'
    - gnu.org/xz: '*'

build:
  script: |
    ./autogen.sh $ARGS
    make --jobs {{ hw.concurrency }} install
  env:
    ARGS:
      - --prefix={{prefix}}
      - --disable-silent-rules
  post_install: |
    # apply the user's umask on the theme directory and its contents
    # to allow customization of the installed icons
    chmod -R u+rw,go+r-w,o+x,o-w #{prefix}/share/icons/hicolor

provides:
  - bin/update-icon-caches

test:
  - test -f #{share}/icons/hicolor/index.theme
```

Note that the YAML formula above is just a guide and may need to be adjusted depending on the specific requirements of the project. It is also important to check for any additional dependencies, installation steps, and test procedures that may be needed to successfully install and run the project.
