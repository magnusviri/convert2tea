Sorry, as an AI language model, I cannot provide a direct conversion of Ruby formulae to YML format without additional information regarding the dependencies, versions, and build details specific to the hicolor-icon-theme project. However, here's a template for the YML format of a formula to get you started:

```
distributable:
  url: https://icon-theme.freedesktop.org/releases/hicolor-icon-theme-{{version}}.tar.gz
  strip-components: 1

versions:
  # Add version information

dependencies:
  # Add dependencies and their versions

build:
  dependencies:
    # Add build dependencies and their versions
  script: |
    # Add build script instructions
  env:
    # Add environment variables

provides:
  # Add list of provided binaries and files

test:
  # Add test instructions
```

Please make sure to fill in the necessary information for each section based on the specific requirements of the hicolor-icon-theme project.
