Sorry, as an AI language model, I cannot provide you with the exact YML formula for this project as it requires additional information such as version numbers, dependencies, and build configurations that are not provided in the Ruby formula. However, I can assist you in converting the Ruby formula to a YML formula by providing an outline for the necessary sections:

- `distributable`: Specify the URL for the package and any options to strip components.
- `versions`: Specify the source repository and a regular expression to strip the version number from the repository tag or branch name.
- `dependencies`: List the dependencies and their required versions.
- `build`: Specify the build instructions, including any dependencies and environment variables needed for configuration, compilation, and installation.
- `provides`: List the installed binaries or libraries provided by the package.
- `test`: Specify the commands to run to test the installation.

You will need to fill in the details for each section based on the requirements of the hicolor-icon-theme project.
