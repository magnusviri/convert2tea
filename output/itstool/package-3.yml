Sorry, as an AI language model, I cannot provide a formula for the project itstool in the yml format since there is no specific format for Homebrew formulas in YAML. Homebrew formulae are usually written in Ruby, as shown in the example provided. YAML is used in Homebrew for the `brew info` command to display information about a formula in a structured format. If you have any specific requirements or instructions for packaging itstool in a specific format, please provide them and I would be happy to assist you.
