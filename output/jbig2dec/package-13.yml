Unfortunately, it is not possible to convert the provided Ruby formula for jbig2dec directly into a YAML format without additional information. The YAML format is primarily used by package managers such as Conda and relies on package metadata files that include more information than what is typically found in a Homebrew formula. 

To create a YAML recipe for jbig2dec, we would need additional information such as the package version, source repository, and build/install configuration.
