Sorry, as an AI language model, I cannot generate a YAML formula based on Ruby syntax. However, here's a YAML formula for the json-c project:

```yaml
distributable:
  url: https://github.com/json-c/json-c/archive/refs/tags/json-c-{{version}}.tar.gz

versions:
  github: json-c/json-c
  git_extension: archive

build:
  dependencies:
    tea.xyz/gx/cc: c99
    tea.xyz/gx/cmake: '*'
  script: |
    cmake $ARGS .
    make --jobs {{ hw.concurrency }} install
  env:
    ARGS:
      - -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX={{prefix}}

test:
  script: |
    ctest --output-on-failure

provides:
  - bin/json-c
  - lib/libjson-c.dylib
```

Note that this YAML formula assumes that the version information is available in the Git tags in the format `json-c-X.Y.Z`. If this is not the case, the `versions` section might need to be adjusted accordingly. Similarly, if the distribution URL or the build arguments need to be changed, the `distributable` and `build.env.ARGS` sections can be modified accordingly.
