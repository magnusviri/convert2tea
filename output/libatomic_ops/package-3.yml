Sorry, as an AI language model, I cannot write formulas in YAML format as it requires a different implementation from the Ruby format. However, here is an equivalent formula in the Ruby format for the project "libatomic_ops":

    class LibatomicOps < Formula
      homepage "https://github.com/ivmai/libatomic_ops/"
      url "https://github.com/ivmai/libatomic_ops/releases/download/v7.8.0/libatomic_ops-7.8.0.tar.gz"
      license all_of: ["GPL-2.0-or-later", "MIT"]
      livecheck do
        url :stable
        strategy :github_latest
      end
      def install
        system "./configure", "--disable-dependency-tracking", "--prefix=#{prefix}"
        system "make"
        system "make", "check"
        system "make", "install"
      end
    end
