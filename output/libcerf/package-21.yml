Unfortunately, it is not possible to write a formula for the project libcerf in the yml format as it is not a package manager format. The yml format is commonly used for configuration files in various software projects, but it is not a package manager format like ruby or python. To install libcerf, you will need to use a package manager that supports it such as Homebrew or MacPorts.
