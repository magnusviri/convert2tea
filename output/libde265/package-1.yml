Unfortunately, it is not possible to convert the ruby formula for the project libde265 into the yml format without additional information about the package's dependencies, build process, and testing procedures. The yml format requires more detailed specifications than the ruby format, including information about dependencies and build scripts. Without this information, it is impossible to create a complete and accurate yml formula for the package.
