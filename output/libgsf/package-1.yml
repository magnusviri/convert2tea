Unfortunately, it is not possible to write a formula for the project libgsf in the yml format as it is not supported by package managers that handle formulae, such as Homebrew. The yml format is commonly used for configuration files and for defining structure in some programming languages, but it is not a valid format for package management. 

Instead, the Ruby formula provided in the example can be used for installing libgsf using Homebrew. Alternatively, other package managers may provide their own formats for defining formulae.
