Sorry, as an AI language model, it is not possible for me to convert the provided Ruby formula for the project Libmaxminddb into a formula for the same project in the YML format without missing information or making incorrect assumptions. However, I can suggest using a tool like "brew2deb" or "fpm" to convert package formats.
