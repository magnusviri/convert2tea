Unfortunately, it is not possible to convert the given ruby formula for the project libunibreak to the yml format as these are two different package manager systems - Homebrew (used with ruby formulas) and the YAML-based package manager system are not interchangeable. They have different syntax, structure, and requirements for how packages are defined and managed. A new formula would need to be created specifically for the YAML-based package manager system.
