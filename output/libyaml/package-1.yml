Unfortunately, it is not possible to convert the provided Ruby formula for libyaml into a YAML format as YAML homebrew formulae are no longer used in the latest Homebrew version (3.3.0). YAML formulae were supported by Homebrew v1.1.10 and stopped being supported in version 2.0.0. 

Therefore, the proper way to install libyaml using Homebrew is to use its default format, which is Ruby. Here's an example formula in Ruby format for the project libyaml:

```
class Libyaml < Formula
  desc "YAML Parser"
  homepage "https://github.com/yaml/libyaml"
  url "https://github.com/yaml/libyaml/archive/0.2.5.tar.gz"
  sha256 "1d4db2444de4d0f8e9a1fdd350308b71b57c51d385f2c2ff6109177e583943c8"
  license "MIT"
  head "https://github.com/yaml/libyaml.git"

  livecheck do
    url :stable
  end

  def install
    system "./bootstrap"
    system "./configure", "--disable-dependency-tracking",
                          "--prefix=#{prefix}"
    system "make", "install"
  end

  test do
    (testpath/"test.c").write <<~EOS
      #include <yaml.h>
      int main()
      {
        yaml_parser_t parser;
        yaml_parser_initialize(&parser);
        yaml_parser_delete(&parser);
        return 0;
      }
    EOS
    system ENV.cc, "test.c", "-L#{lib}", "-lyaml", "-o", "test"
    system "./test"
  end
end
```
