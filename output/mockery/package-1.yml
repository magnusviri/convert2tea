Unfortunately, it is not possible to write a formula for the project mockery in the yml format as it only supports certain package managers and package formats such as apt-get, Homebrew, and Chocolatey. The yml format mentioned in the prompt is for a specific tool called Omnibus, which is used to create cross-platform installers. However, here's an example formula for the project mockery in the Homebrew format:

```

  desc "Mockery is a mocking framework for Go."

  def install
    ldflags = "-s -w -X github.com/vektra/mockery/v2/pkg/logging.SemVer=v#{version}"
    system "go", "build", *std_go_args(ldflags: ldflags)

    fish_completion.install "contrib/completion/fish/mockery.fish"
  end

  test do
    (testpath/"interface.go").write <<~EOS
      package main

      type MyInterface interface {
         Method1(a string, b int) error
         Method2(c bool) (string, error)
      }
    EOS
    system "#{bin}/mockery", "--all", "--output", testpath, "--case", "underscore", "main.MyInterface"
    assert_predicate testpath/"mockery_main_my_interface.go", :exist?
  end
end
```
