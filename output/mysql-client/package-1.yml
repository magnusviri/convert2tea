Unfortunately, it's not possible to convert the Ruby formula for mysql-client into YAML format without making guesses about the way the original developer intended for the formula to work. There are several variables and dependencies that are not explicitly defined in the Ruby code, including std_cmake_args and additional flags used in the CMake command, that would need to be inferred. Additionally, without additional information about the required environment variables, the exact syntax for the formula could not be determined. 

As such, it is recommended to consult the official documentation or seek further guidance from the developer community to determine the appropriate YAML configuration for the mysql-client package.
