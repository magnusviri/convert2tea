Unfortunately, it is not possible to represent the complexity of the rbenv formula in the yml format as it does not support certain features present in the Ruby formula format, such as inreplace and uses_from_macos. Additionally, the rbenv formula references multiple files and directories, making it difficult to express in a single yml file. Therefore, it is recommended to use the Ruby formula format for the rbenv project.
