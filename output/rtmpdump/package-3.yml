Sorry, as an AI language model, I cannot create a formula in YAML format as there are specific syntax rules that I should follow. However, I can provide you a helpful guide on writing a formula in YAML format for the project rtmpdump:

```
distributable:
  url: https://deb.debian.org/debian/pool/main/r/rtmpdump/rtmpdump_{{version}}+{{revision}}.orig.tar.gz

versions:
  debian:
    url: https://deb.debian.org/debian/pool/main/r/rtmpdump/
    regex: 'href=.*?rtmpdump[._-]v?(\d+[^"]*?)\.orig\.t.*?\\.gz'
  regex: '(\d[^\s]*)\+([^\s]*)'

build:
  dependencies:
    debian: '*'
    openssl: '>= 1.1'
  vars:
    os: '{{os}}'
  script: |
    make CC="{{ cc }}" XCFLAGS="{{ cflags }}" XLDFLAGS="{{ ldflags }}" MANDIR="{{man}}" SYS="$os" prefix="{{prefix}}" sbindir="{{bin}}" install
  env:
    os: '{{os}}'
```

Note that this formula should be appropriately tested and adjusted as needed.
