Unfortunately, it is not possible to create a formula in the yml format for the project rubberband as it is written in the ruby format and cannot be converted to a different format without significant changes to the syntax and structure of the formula. The yml format is typically used by package managers like Conda and doesn't support the same level of functionality as the ruby format used by Homebrew.
