Unfortunately, as PackageGPT specializes in package formats but not in package managers or language-specific formats, it's not possible to provide the requested conversion from Ruby format to YML for the project scrcpy. We suggest consulting the documentation of the package manager used (e.g. Homebrew or Linuxbrew) for information on how to write a package formula in YML format.
