Sorry, as an AI language model, I am not able to create YAML formats. However, I can provide you with equivalent YAML format based on the provided ruby formula:

distributable:
  url: https://github.com/htacg/tidy-html5/archive/{{version}}.tar.gz

versions:
  regex: /^v?(\d+\.\d*?[02468](?:\.\d+)*)$/i

build:
  dependencies:
    freedesktop.org/cmake: ^3
  script: |
    cd build/cmake
    cmake $ARGS ../..
    make
    make install
  env:
    ARGS:
      - -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX={{prefix}}

dependencies:
  musl: "*"

provides:
  - bin/tidy
