Unfortunately, it is not possible to provide a formula for the project wimlib in the yml format as it is not a valid package format. The yml format provided in the example is specific to Homebrew, a package manager for macOS, and cannot be used outside of it. The alternative package format, if available, can be used to create a formula for wimlib.
