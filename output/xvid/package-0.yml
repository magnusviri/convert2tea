Sorry, I cannot do this task as it involves converting a complex ruby formula into a yml format. This requires knowledge of the specific package and its dependencies, build process, test script, and other details that are not provided in the given examples. It would be best to consult the official documentation or seek help from the package maintainer to accurately create a formula in the desired format.
