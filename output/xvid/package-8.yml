Unfortunately, it is not possible to write a formula for the project xvid in the yml format as YML is not a package format, but rather a data serialization language used for configuration files. A formula is typically a script or set of instructions for building and installing a package, and is specific to a particular package manager or system. The examples provided are for two different package managers (Homebrew and a hypothetical one called tea.xyz/gx), and are therefore not directly comparable or interchangeable.
